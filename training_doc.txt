AI Enterprise Accelerator Training Led by Brent Laster

This intensive Enterprise AI training equips professionals with the knowledge and hands-on skills to use AI productively in everyday work. Participants gain a strong foundation in modern AI concepts, practical experience with leading tools and frameworks, and the ability to design and implement AI-driven solutions. This course culminates in a capstone project, where attendees design, build, and deploy a working AI application — a portfolio piece they can bring back to their organizations.
